## Cloning Down the repo 
If you clone down the repo and import project in Xcode view things you'll have to do :-) -- well things I had to do.

1. Files will be red click `File > Add Files to DreamListener` and add the files -- stupid I know.
2. Click Project `DreamLister` it's blue icon in Xcode project navigator. From there click Build Phases. Expand the column `Compile Sources` from there remove the files that are grey. 
3. Build and Run project it should work :-) 


` If not figure it out yourself because I'm dumb :) `
